Welcome to my Spotify Overlay. This overlay allows you to control Spotify playback without having to switch applications. I built it on python, utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI and pyCurl to access the Spotify API.

**If downloading zip**
To run, simply run the shortcut within the SpotifyOverlay-main folder.

**If cloning repo**
To run, simply run the shortcut within the SpotifyOverlay folder.
