Welcome to my Spotify Overlay. This overlay allows you to control Spotify playback without having to switch applications/tabs. 

You can also control playback on your phone or speaker from said overlay.

I built it on python, utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI and pyCurl to access the Spotify API.

To Run, simply download the project as a zip file. 

Go to the folder with your operating system on it.

Run the "SpotifyOverlay" executable file within that folder.
