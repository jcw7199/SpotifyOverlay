Welcome to my Spotify Overlay. This overlay allows you to control Spotify playback without having to switch applications/tabs. 

You can also control playback on your phone or speaker from said overlay.

I built it on python, utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI and pyCurl to access the Spotify API.

To Run, simply download the project as a zip file. Then run the "SpotifyOverlay" exe file. The file will be in the same folder as the README.md

To see a video demo of the app, please visit my website: https://jcw7199.pythonanywhere.com/spotify
