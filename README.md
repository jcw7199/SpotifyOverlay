Welcome to my Spotify Overlay. This overlay allows you to control Spotify playback without having to switch tabs. I built it on python, utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI and pyCurl to access the Spotify API.

To Run, simply run the "app" shortcut within the SpotifyOverlay folder.

**If you download the project as a zip, the folder will be called SpotifyOverlay-main**
continue navigating through the folders until you find the app shortcut (will be in the same folder as the README.md)

To see screenshots of it in action, please visit my website: https://jcw7199.pythonanywhere.com/spotify
